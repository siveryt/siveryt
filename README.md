### Hello there world! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

Hi, I'm Sivery. I would call myself a Full-Stack Web and Appdeveloper. I develop websites for the most part, but I also love it to administrate Linux-server environments, create new iOS Apps in Swift or make a great new Discord-Bot.

I'm very open to learn new stuff, so I constantly change from technology tro technology.
